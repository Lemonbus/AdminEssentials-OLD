# Thanks for using my plugin. In this file, you can configure several settings (Generally, when you are editing one of the messages, colorcodes [the & sign] will work) #
Settings:
  prefix: '&6[&bAdminEssentials&6] ' # The prefix that comes before most messages below V *NOTE* You want to make the prefix end with a space, so it looks nice #
  adminAddMessage: '&dYou are now in ADMIN mode' # This is the message that is sent to admins when they use /admin and get put into admin mode #
  adminRemoveMessage: '&aYou are now in PLAY mode' # Opposite of the above ^ #
  clearchat-message: '&bChat has been cleared by &a%PLAYER%' # In this case, the prefix defined above will be placed before the message. %PLAYER% is the sender's name. #
  your-chat-has-been-cleared: '&bYour chat has been cleared by &a%PLAYER%' # This is the message that is sent to players when they use /pcc - prefix is included in this message #
  mutechat-message: '&bChat has been &cmuted&b by &a%PLAYER%' # This is the message that is broadcasted when you mute the chat #
  unMutechat-message: '&bChat has been &aunmuted&b by &a%PLAYER%' # This is the message that is broadcasted when you unmute the chat #
  chat-is-muted: '&cSorry, chat is currently muted!' # The message that is sent to players when they cannot chat because chat is muted #
  adminOnDutyPrefixEnabled: false # This will enable the thing below V *NOTE* This is still being worked on, please only use it if you really want it #
  adminOnDutyPrefix: '&9[&4On Duty&9]&c ' # If the player is in admin mode, and they type a message into chat, what should the prefix be? #
